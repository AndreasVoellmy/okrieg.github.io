          <p>Some experience in one or more of the following is preferred in possible team members:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> Python
	    <li> Operating Systems (e.g. CS 552 is recommended)
	    <li> Linux system (e.g. CS 410, having a personal machine running Linux)
          </ul>

	  What is the MOC-UI?
	  </h3>
	  <p>
	  <a href="https://github.com/CCI-MOC/haas">HaaS</a>
	  is a tool for
	  partitioning datacenters.  It allows cloud and none cloud
	  services to be stood up alongside each other, and physical
	  hardware to be moved back and forth between them. </p>

	  <p>Currently, the best deployment options we
	  have involve PXE-booting the nodes into an install image---even
	  just the BIOS POST, the first part of this process, can take
	  minutes.  A faster deployment method is key to users scaling
	  their application up more rapidly.</p>

	  <p>
	  While it is not acceptable for a general environment, users
	  that have some level of trust with each other could use
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kexec">kexec</a> to
	  move from a linux kernel to a pre-boot environment without
	  going through a full hardware reboot.  As long as different
	  users of the HaaS trust each other to leave machines in a state
	  that is ready to kexec, then this could be used to quickly
	  deploy to machines allocated with the HaaS.  Rather than
	  complicating the existing HaaS layer to do this, we envision
	  implementing this as a new HaaS layer, shared by a group of
	  users that trust each other, on top of a base HaaS layer.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	  Fast provisioning is just an example of recursive HaaS.
	  There are a number of interesting research projects that we
	  see a recursive HaaS implementation enabling. 
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>Potential Goals: 
          <ul>
	    <li> Develop a simple pass through recursive HaaS
          implementation.
	    <li> Add kexec support, and build a pre-boot environment
          that can be provisioned against. 
	    <li> Demonstrate a piece of software scaling up through kexec
	    <li> Measure performance of the kexec method, compared to a cold boot
	    <li> Characterize level of trust needed between users---potentially
	    even prototype some possible attacks
	    <li> Students could also investigate alternate fast deployment methods
          </ul> </p>
